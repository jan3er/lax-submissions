The locality theorem of the source note (arXiv:2606.23180, Theorem 1)
and its normal form (Corollary 7), discharging the two axioms of
`Lax3.Locality` and `Lax3.NormalForm`.

The proof is the source's structural induction on the formula, with the
rank obtained at each step by inverting the `DRank` derivation. Atoms and
boolean connectives are immediate; the two quantifiers are where the
imported machinery enters.

* **Local quantification** `exL r g ψ`. The induction hypothesis turns
  the body into a boolean combination of local formulas and scatter
  sentences. Scatter sentences are *sentences*, so their truth does not
  depend on the bound variable and the finitely many truth patterns of
  them may be enumerated outside the quantifier — that is
  `BCAlgebra.exists_eval_sum_iff`. Under a fixed pattern what is left is
  a boolean combination of local formulas, which `BCAlgebra.interp`
  collapses to a single local formula (`patternFml` below); the
  quantifier is put back in front of it, guard set and radius unchanged,
  and `BCAlgebra.pullOut` rebuilds one combination. This is `exL_step`.
* **Unrestricted quantification** `exU ψ` at arity zero. There is no
  variable for a guard to be local to, and the source's answer is a
  scatter sentence: the collapsed formula `ψ_τ` of each pattern is
  satisfiable exactly when the distinguished scattered subset of the set
  it defines is nonempty, which is the scatter sentence
  `⟨4ρ⁻(1, q), ψ_τ, 1⟩` — of distance rank `(0, q + 1)` with rank witness
  `i = 1`. This is `exU_zero_step`; the equivalence itself is
  `scatterSentence_sat_one_iff`, where maximality of the distinguished
  set supplies the nonempty direction through
  `ScatterCore.exists_withinDist_of_maximal`.
* **Unrestricted quantification** `exU ψ` at positive arity. The witness
  is split classically at radius ρ⁻(k+1, q): a near witness is a local
  quantification with guard set `Finset.univ`, handled by the same
  `exL_step` (the radius is admissible by `rhoMinus_le_rhoPlus`); a far
  witness is separated from the tuple by `Separation.separate` with the
  capsule split `e₁ = Fin.castSucc`, `e₂ = const (Fin.last k)`, and each
  capsule `β` is then discharged by `FarQuant.farQuant`. This is
  `exU_pos_step` and `exU_far_step`.

The normal form is the locality theorem at the maximum-size scatter
choice with the scatter sentences written out in the logic:
`ScatterFml.sat_scatterFml` replaces each scatter atom, `BCAlgebra.eval_congr`
carries the replacement through the combination, and the five bridges of
`Lax3Proofs.ScatterFml` turn the scatter rank the theorem produces into
the five conditions the corollary states.

# Formalization notes

The always-true formula that `BCAlgebra.interp` needs for the empty
combination is `Separation.alwaysTrue`, the atom `x₀ = x₀`, and not
`Lax3.NormalForm.verum`: the latter spends an unrestricted quantifier and
is not local, so it cannot appear inside a formula the theorem claims is
local. This is why `patternFml` carries a proof that the context is
nonempty — at arity zero there is no such atom, and no formula is
collapsed there either, since the sentence case produces a scatter
sentence instead.

`Separation.separate` and `FarQuant.farQuant` both conclude with a `∀`
over the graph and the environment, so the objects they produce are
chosen once per pattern, before any graph is fixed, exactly as the
induction hypothesis is. The choice over the list of separated pairs is
made with `choose`; `farQuant` is totalized to a function on all of
`DistFO L 1` first, its hypotheses moved inside the existential, so that
`choose` yields a function that does not depend on a membership proof.

No tactic here is handed a concept-side definition: `Sat`, `IsLocal`,
`BC.eval`, `BC.atoms`, `ScatterSentence.Sat` and `ScatterSentence.DRank`
are taken apart through the clause lemmas of `Lax3Proofs.SyntaxLemmas`,
`Lax3Proofs.BCAlgebra` and `Lax3Proofs.ScatterFml`, and every radius
inequality goes through `Lax3Proofs.Horizon`.
`Lax3Proofs.FarQuant` is deliberately not opened — it carries its own
copies of the `BC` clause lemmas, which would make every use of
`BCAlgebra.eval_and` and its siblings ambiguous — so its one export is
named qualified.

scatter sentence demanding a single witness.

/-! ### The two theorems -/

/--
---
conclusion: Lax3.Locality.locality
---
**The locality theorem** (Theorem 1 of arXiv:2606.23180): every formula
of distance rank `(k, q)` is equivalent to a boolean combination of local
formulas and scatter sentences, all of distance rank `(k, q)`.

# Proof strategy

Structural induction on the formula, the rank read off by inverting the
`DRank` derivation at each step. Atoms are their own combinations,
boolean connectives compose the combinations of their parts, and both
quantifiers first apply the induction hypothesis to the body and then
pull the scatter sentences — being sentences, they do not see the bound
variable — outside the quantifier, leaving one local formula per truth
pattern of them. A local quantifier is then simply put back in front of
that formula. An unrestricted quantifier is the source's real case: over
an empty context it becomes a scatter sentence with a single witness,
and otherwise the witness is split into a near one, which is a local
quantification guarded over the whole tuple, and a far one, which the
separation lemma and the far-quantification lemma turn into local
formulas and scatter sentences. See the module docstring for the map of
the imported pieces.

conclusion: Lax3.NormalForm.normalForm
---
**The normal form for distance logic** (Corollary 7 of
arXiv:2606.23180): for `q ≥ 1`, every formula of distance rank `(k, q)`
is equivalent to a boolean combination of local formulas of distance rank
`(k, q)` and the written-out sentences "there are `t` vertices, pairwise
at distance larger than `r`, all satisfying `β`".

# Proof strategy

The locality theorem at the maximum-size scatter choice, with the same
boolean combination. With that choice a scatter sentence is definable in
the logic — `Lax3Proofs.ScatterFml.sat_scatterFml` — so replacing each
scatter atom's evaluation by satisfaction of `scatterFml` changes no
truth value, and `Lax3Proofs.BCAlgebra.eval_congr` carries the
replacement through the combination. The five conditions the corollary
states about a scatter atom are the five bridges of
`Lax3Proofs.ScatterFml` applied to the distance rank the locality theorem
already provides; `q ≥ 1` is used by exactly one of them, the one that
climbs the rank witness back to `(k + 1, q − 1)`.
